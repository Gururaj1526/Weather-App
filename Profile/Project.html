        <dd>Event management is the process by which an event is planned, prepared, and produced. 
            An event manager’s job is to oversee and arrange every aspect of an event, including 
            researching, planning, organizing, implementing, controlling, and evaluating an event’s 
            design, activities, and production.</dd><br>
            <dd>Event management encompasses a multitude of types of events. Although the 
                industry has delineated itself into various categories, all represent the planning and 
                production of an event that brings people together at a particular time, in a particular 
                place, for a particular purpose.  </dd>
